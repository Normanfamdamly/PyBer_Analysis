# PyBer_Analysis Modules 5 challenge

## PyBer - Ride-Sharing Overview of the Analysis

Thee assignment was to create a DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.  utilizing the Matplotlib, Pandas and Python we will merge the the city and ride data to create a multiple-line graph that illustrates the total weekly fares for each city type.  Then they are looking for any recommendations as to what they can do to better their penetration in the lower city types.

## Results

The ride-sharing data amongst the three city types is quite varying as you can see from the chart above.  Total rides goes from 125 in the rural to 1625 in the urban.  While the total drivers follows the same pattern, going from 78 in the rural to 2405 in the urban.  As expected you see total fares for urban being well over $39k, but urban maintains the lowest average fare per ride and the lowest fare per driver as well.
