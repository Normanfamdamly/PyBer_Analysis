# PyBer_Analysis Modules 5 challenge

## PyBer - Ride-Sharing Overview of the Analysis

The assignment was to create a DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.  utilizing the Matplotlib, Pandas and Python we will merge the city and ride data to create a multiple-line graph that illustrates the total weekly fares for each city type.  Then they are looking for any recommendations as to what they can do to better their penetration in the lower city types.

## Results

The ride-sharing data amongst the three city types is quite varying as you can see from the chart above.  Total rides go from 125 in the rural to 1625 in the urban.  While the total drivers follow the same pattern, going from 78 in the rural to 2405 in the urban.  As expected, you see total fares for urban being well over $39k, but urban maintains the lowest average fare per ride and the lowest fare per driver as well.   


## Summary

 1. I think further analysis is needed to understand the use in the rural community.  Understanding its uses could lead to lower prices, which could lead to more usage and actually increase overall profit. 
 2. Urban usage is going to always be higher due to the tendency for business travelers to not rent cars and city dwellers to not own cars. So, any deals that can be done to get more people utilizing the system is always a good advertising angle to take. 
 3. I think a good profit building scheme for the CEO to concentrate on is ride-sharing from the city to the suburban neighborhood for those who work downtown. This could increase profits and help increase carpooling into the city.
